# Assumptions Made

1. I have noticed that there are rows with "duplicate" commitments my assumption here is that because there is no unique identifier for a commitment I will treat duplicates as 2 commitments with the same amount

2. From basic examination of the data in the csv file it seems that the data is fairly clean and does not contain errors, so i did not include any error handling when ingesting the data.
